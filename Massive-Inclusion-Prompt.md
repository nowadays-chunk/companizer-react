Now I have finished the first version of the project.
Now I have the structure that makes it work.

But I don't have a few things :

A) Structure modification

1. I want create a new nested list for the left drawer. And it should be based on what's already on the drawer and the suggested new titles in the Entities.md file.

2. Fo every element of those entities I want to regenerate the "fieldsConfig" object for it both for that entity and for its "Details" folder related accumulatable rows. (details) And do not forget to use the common fields everywhere.

3. I want also to generate for those entities a specific "stepsConfig" object for its processing workflow.

B) I want you to generate a multi-implementation-plans for each of those page in order to add useful React components to them, the common ones but also the custom and the targetted ones.

1. I want thos pages to be full of workflow buttons, with every working button a specific functionality to it.

C) Do not remove any of the previous functionalities from the code; Just keep restructuring and adding functionalities.

D) After generating everything, Give the final and merged SQL Schema to recreate the DATABASE. But this time add the constraints on every table that is demanding it.

1. The tables should be in alphabtical order

2. And give me another helper script for me to drop the tables in correct order.

E) Regenerate the Documentation with the nested list of Routes and the its allowed parameters; for example the nest entities names. THIS DOCUMENTATION WILL BE USED TO PROMPT THE AI working on the backend

F) When finished ; Add The Many-To-Many Relationship Between The Necessary Tables. And It must be Rational To The View Of The Business Logic.
